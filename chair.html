        <h2><center> A Search for "Ergosignatures" with the Adam J. Burgasser Chair</center> </h2>
        <p><big><b>Abstract:</big></b> We propose to search for extraterrestrial civilizations with advanced chair-building technology using the Adam J. Burgasser Chair in Astrophysics. Once a civilization reaches a certain level of comfort in their seating technology, they will naturally wish to broadcast their reclining prowess to the rest of the galaxy. We will search for these signatures of advanced ergonomic technology, also known as "ergosignatures," by taking inspiration (not to mention comfort and relaxation) from the Burgasser Chair. The result of our search will be the first constraints of Î·<sub>chair</sub>, the term in the Drake Equation that represents fraction of civilizations capable of advanced posterior support.  
        
        </p>
        
        
        
        <p> <big><b>Intellectual Merit:</b></big> The search for life elsewhere in the universe is a major focus of astronomers today. Currently, most work towards detecting life elsewhere focuses on the search for "biosignatures" -- signs of a living biosphere such as an oxygen-rich atmosphere and the "red edge" spectral absorption feature associated with chlorophyll -- or "technosignatures" -- signs of technologically advanced civilizations such as radio transmissions or rapid laser pulses. Sadly, however, little to no effort has focused on the search for "ergosignatures", the signs of civilizations which have reached a level of enlightenment in the art of furniture design. </p>
        
        <p> <b>We aim to rectify this oversight with our groundbreaking search for ergosignatures using the Burgasser Chair.</b> Any civilization capable of achieving advanced ergonomic technology will certainly choose to display their furniture-designing prowess to the rest of the galaxy, and we will seek out these signatures. In the same way that a technological civilization might signal their mathematical prowess by <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_(1997_American_film)'>sending a message encoded in prime numbers</a>, an ergonomically advanced civilization will likely send signals encoded in the most comfortable and classic furniture design imaginable: the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eames_Lounge_Chair'>Eames chair</a>.</p>
        
        <p>  <a href='#figure1'>Figure 1</a> shows a simulated TESS light curve of a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K2-141b'>nearby planet-hosting star</a>, as it is transited by an artificial occulter shaped like a gigantic Eames chair. We will search for transits with the characteristic asymmetry caused by the imbalance between the chair itself and the smaller ottoman.  (In general, while TESS can detect Eames chairs as small as Earth, it will be difficult to distinguish them from ordinary exoplanets unless they are much larger. We will therefore lack sensitivity to the less advanced civilizations incapable of building Eames chairs larger than <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_giant'>solar system ice giants</a>. Then again, if a civilization can't even build a space chair the size of Jupiter, are they even worth our time?)

        <small><b> Figure 1: </b>Simulated <i>TESS</i> light curve of an Eames chair transiting a nearby star. In this simulation, the effective radius of the chair is similar to that of Jupiter, and the chair orbits the star at a speed of 3.6 km/s in its orbit. Yes, I actually did these calculations, and this is actually the transit shape that you would get from a giant Eames chair flying through space. No, you don't want to know how long it took me.  <small>

         <p>A crucial component of our project will be the careful consideration of different viewing geometries for the chair and how these viewing angles affect the shape of the transits in TESS data. <a href='#figure1'>Figure 1</a> shows the chair as viewed from the side (the typical viewing geometry for observers who do not have their own Eames chair, and instead spend their time looking on in jealousy as their colleagues lounge comfortably). While this viewing geometry is familiar to most astronomers (especially those at MIT who have not held the Burgasser Chair themselves), an Eames-capable extraterrestrial civilization may wish to highlight their own comfort by orienting the giant space chair as one might observe it <i>while sitting in the chair</i>. We therefore will spend our tenure with the Burgasser Chair performing a thorough inspection from different angles -- with a particular focus on viewing geometries <i>only visible</i> to a comfortably reclining observer. <b> Our project, therefore, cannot succeed without the physical support of the Burgasser Chair. </b> </p>

        <p><b><big>Broader Impacts:</big></b>
        
        In parallel to our observational effort to detect the first extraterrestrial civilizations capable of advanced furniture design, we will embark on a campaign to educate the public on the storied history of chair science. We will open and operate the "Museum of Chairs:" a free resource to the public with exhibits describing some of the greatest chair-related discoveries in history, as well as interactive activities to teach children the fundamentals of chair design. <a href='#figure2'> Figure 2 </a> shows a mock-up of one of the main museum exhibits.<p> 
        
        <p> In addition to opening the Museum of Chairs, we promote chair science in other ways. First, we will include an acknowledgement of support from the Burgasser Chair in our publications, and we will maintain a website dedicated to the history of the Burgasser Chair and its scientific legacy. The website will also host this proposal, the code used to make <a href='#figure1'>Figure 1</a>, and the simulated TESS light curve with an Eames transit.
